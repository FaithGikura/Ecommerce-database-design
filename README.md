#  E-commerce Database Design

This project is a peer group assignment focused on mastering **database design** for an **e-commerce platform**. It includes an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a fully functional SQL schema that defines the necessary tables and relationships to support an online store.

---

##  Objective

- Design a robust and scalable relational database for an e-commerce platform.
- Understand relationships between entities such as products, categories, variations, and attributes.
- Collaborate effectively as a team to analyze, design, and implement the database structure.

---

##  Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

> You can find the ERD in the `ERD.png` file in this repository.

Created using [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io), the ERD includes the following key entities:

- **brand**
- **product_category**
- **product**
- **product_item**
- **product_image**
- **color**
- **size_category**
- **size_option**
- **product_variation**
- **attribute_category**
- **attribute_type**
- **product_attribute**

Each table includes proper primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to maintain data integrity.

---

## Database Schema

The database schema is defined in the file [`ecommerce.sql`](./ecommerce.sql). It includes:

- Table creation statements (`CREATE TABLE`)
- Primary and foreign key definitions
- Data types appropriate for each column
- Constraints and relationships between tables

You can run the SQL file in any **MySQL-compatible** database server to set up the database.

---

##  Tools Used

- **dbdiagram.io** – for ERD design
- **MySQL** – for database implementation
- **GitHub** – for version control and collaboration

---

## Team Collaboration

Each team member contributed to the following:

- Brainstorming entities and attributes
- Designing the ERD structure
- Writing and reviewing the SQL schema
- Setting up the GitHub repository
- Documentation and final presentation
